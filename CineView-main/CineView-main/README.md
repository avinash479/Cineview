# CineView
The project “CineView: Discover the World of Cinema”, offers to provide a platform for users to access movie details and check the movie reviews for binge watch ! The project is implemented using the Java programming language, utilizing the TMDB (The Movie Database) API for retrieving movie information. By using the power of the TMDB API, CineView ensures that the movie database is constantly updated with the latest information, the overview of the movie the user selected, including release dates, cast and crew details, ratings, and watch the trailer of the movie selected. This integration allows user to stay up to date with the latest movies and about what they want to watch and enjoy their lovely weekend.
CineView uses Java's capabilities to handle API integration, data management, and user interaction within the command-line environment. Movie studios will be able to track the popularity of their movies and to get see vote average or popularity. This will help the studios to see which type of genres are people loving and shoot their own movies according to that. We are using different java concepts here  and importing modules like “HttpURLConnection” to get response from the API. As the project deals ,the user can select the specific movie name and see the specific details or full details of the movie according to his input in the command line. Specific options will be provided and if the user wants to watch the trailer of the movie then user can use that capability too by getting the URL of the trailer in the command line environment .Only one movie can be selected and selection of TV series will not be considered.
So  concluding this, project provides a command-line interface that enables users to access movie details, submit reviews, and explore new movies efficiently. With its Java implementation and integration of the TMDB API, the project offers a streamlined solution for movie information retrieval and review management in a terminal-based environment.
